# TweetSenseAI
## Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language.
## Objectives of the Project
TweetSenseAI is a sentiment analysis model designed to detect the sentiments expressed in tweets. By leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it provides valuable insights into public opinion and trends based on Twitter data.

## Python Libraries Used:
- NumPy: Numerical computations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization using static plots.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization with advanced styles.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
- NLTK: Natural language processing tasks.
## About the Dataset
The dataset used to design this model was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
## Results
In the TweetSenseAI project, four machine learning models were trained and evaluated for sentiment analysis on a dataset of 1.6 million tweets:
- Logistic Regression
- LinearSVC
- Naive Bayes
- SGDClassifiers
  Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 78.24%, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding and predicting tweet sentiments. Below is the accuracy comparison graph for all four models.
