# TweetSenseAI
## Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language.
## Objectives of the Project
TweetSenseAI is a sentiment analysis model designed to detect the sentiments expressed in tweets. By leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it provides valuable insights into public opinion and trends based on Twitter data.
